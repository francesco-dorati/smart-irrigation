# 🌿 Autonomous Plant Watering System

## Overview

This project aims to develop a **smart** and **autonomous** system for **watering indoor or outdoor plants**.  
The system is designed to **monitor soil moisture levels** and **automatically water** each plant when needed, making plant care effortless and reliable.


## 🌱 The Product

This system is designed to **take care of each plant separately** and **autonomously**.  
It provides **individualized watering** for each plant, ensuring they get exactly what they need—no more, no less.  
Perfect for balconies, gardens, or indoor setups.

1. **⚙️ Main Unit**  
   The central hub of the watering system, consisting of the **controller** and **water tank**.
   - 🪴 **Expandable** with up to **8 plants**  
   - 🔋 **Self-Sufficient** thanks to a **3500mAh battery**  
   - ☀️ **Solar Power** for complete autonomy

2. **🌿 Plant Unit**  
   A compact module attached to each plant, designed for **individual care**.
   - 📟 Composed of a **microcontroller**, **humidity sensor** and a **water pump**
   - 🔌 Connects to the Main Unit via an **Ethernet cable** and **water pipe**
   - 📏 Can be placed **up to 5 meters away** from the Main Unit

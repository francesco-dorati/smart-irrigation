# 🌿 Autonomous Plant Watering System

## Overview

This project aims to develop a **smart** and **autonomous** system for **watering indoor or outdoor plants**. The system is designed to **monitor soil moisture levels** and **automatically water** each plant when needed, making plant care effortless and reliable.

## Key Objectives

- 🌱 **Autonomous Plant Care**: Automatically water plants based on **soil moisture levels** without human intervention.
- 🔄 **Periodic Monitoring**: Measure soil humidity twice a day to check if each plant requires watering.
- 💧 **Per-Plant Watering**: Independently control water delivery to each plant based on its **specific needs**.
- 🔋 **Energy Efficient**: Operate on battery power, optimized with deep sleep cycles for **long-term use**.
- ☀️ **Solar Optional**: Include the option to recharge the system via **solar panel** for **complete autonomy**.
- 🧠 **Expandable Architecture**: Start with support for 3 plants and scale **up to 6 or more** with minimal changes.
- 📦 **Compact & Modular**: Designed to be simple to install and easy to maintain for home or small-scale use.
- 📊 **Data Logging**: Record historical moisture and watering events for **analysis** (without requiring internet).
